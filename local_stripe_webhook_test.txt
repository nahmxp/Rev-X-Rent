Local Stripe Webhook Testing Guide

This guide explains how to test Stripe webhooks locally using the Stripe CLI.

1.  **Ensure your local development server is running:**
    *   Start your Next.js development server (e.g., `npm run dev`). Make sure your application is accessible locally, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.

2.  **Install the Stripe CLI:**
    *   If you haven't already, install the Stripe CLI by following the instructions in the Stripe documentation: [https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli).

3.  **Log in to your Stripe account via the CLI:**
    *   Open your terminal and run: `stripe login`
    *   This will open a browser window for you to authenticate with your Stripe account.

4.  **Forward webhook events to your local endpoint:**
    *   In your terminal, run the following command:
        ```bash
        stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/payment/webhook
        ```
        *   Replace `3000` with the port your local development server is running on if it's different.
        *   This command tells the Stripe CLI to listen for events from your Stripe account and forward them to your specified local endpoint.
    *   The CLI will output a **Webhook secret signing key** (starts with `whsec_`). Copy this key.

5.  **Add the local webhook secret to your `.env.local` file:**
    *   Open the `.env.local` file in the root of your project.
    *   Add or update the `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` variable with the key you just copied from the Stripe CLI:
        ```
        STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_LOCAL_WEBHOOK_SECRET
        ```
    *   Make sure you are using your **test** Stripe keys (`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...`) in your `.env.local` for local testing.

6.  **Restart your local development server:**
    *   If your server was running when you updated `.env.local`, stop it and restart it (`npm run dev`) to load the new environment variable.

7.  **Trigger a webhook event:**
    *   Now, when you trigger an event in your local environment that would normally send a webhook (like completing a payment through Stripe Checkout), the Stripe CLI will intercept it and forward it to your local webhook endpoint (`/api/payment/webhook`).
    *   You should see logs in both your Stripe CLI terminal (indicating receipt and forwarding) and your Next.js development server terminal (indicating the webhook API route was hit and processed).
