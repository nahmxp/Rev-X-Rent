## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB (optional, in-memory fallback available)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nahmxp/Rev-X-Rent.git
cd Rev-X-Rent
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your MongoDB connection string:
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret-key (optional, has development fallback)
```

> **Note**: The application includes a fallback in-memory database for development without MongoDB.
> **Note**: The application uses a hardcoded fallback JWT secret for development if JWT_SECRET is not provided.

4. Run the development server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Admin Account Setup

To access admin features, you'll need to create an admin account:

1. Register a new account through the signup page
2. If using the in-memory database, the first created account will automatically have admin privileges
3. For MongoDB deployments, you can manually set the `isAdmin` flag to `true` in the database or use an existing admin account to promote users

Once logged in as an admin, you'll see additional options in the navigation menu, including:
- Users Dashboard
- Add Product button
- Admin-specific actions throughout the interface

## Authentication Troubleshooting

If you encounter authentication issues:

1. Check browser cookies to ensure `auth_token` is being properly set
2. Verify that your admin user has the `isAdmin` flag set to `true` in the database
3. The application uses HTTP-only cookies for authentication tokens, so they won't be accessible via JavaScript
4. For development environments, the application uses a hardcoded JWT secret if none is provided in `.env.local`
5. If you're experiencing "Authentication required" errors, try logging out and back in

## Deployment

This application can be easily deployed to Vercel:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Or using Vercel CLI:

```bash
vercel
```
