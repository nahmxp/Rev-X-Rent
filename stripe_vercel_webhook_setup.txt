Stripe Vercel Webhook Setup Guide

This guide outlines the steps to configure Stripe webhooks for your application deployed on Vercel.

1.  **Deploy your application to Vercel:**
    *   Ensure your latest code (including the webhook API route at `/api/payment/webhook.js`) is pushed to your Git repository connected to Vercel.
    *   Vercel will automatically build and deploy your application, assigning it a public URL (e.g., `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`).

2.  **Obtain your Live Stripe API Keys:**
    *   Log in to your Stripe Dashboard.
    *   Go to `Developers` > `API keys`.
    *   Copy your **Live Publishable key** (starts with `pk_live_`).
    *   Copy your **Live Secret key** (starts with `sk_live_`).

3.  **Add Live API Keys and Webhook Secret to Vercel Environment Variables:**
    *   Go to your Vercel Dashboard and navigate to your project.
    *   Go to `Settings` > `Environment Variables`.
    *   Add the following environment variables:
        *   `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Paste your **Live Secret key** here.
        *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: Paste your **Live Publishable key** here.
        *   `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: You will get this in the next step, leave this blank for now or use a temporary placeholder.
    *   Ensure these variables are applied to the appropriate environments (Production, Preview, Development).
    *   Redeploy your Vercel project after adding/updating environment variables.

4.  **Add a Webhook Endpoint in Stripe for Vercel:**
    *   In your Stripe Dashboard, go to `Developers` > `Webhooks`.
    *   Click `Add endpoint`.
    *   For the **Endpoint URL**, enter the public URL of your Vercel deployment followed by `/api/payment/webhook` (e.g., `https://your-project-name.vercel.app/api/payment/webhook`).
    *   For **Version**, select the recommended API version or the one your Stripe library is using.
    *   Under **Select events to listen to**, choose the events relevant to your application. At minimum, select `checkout.session.completed` to update order status after payment.
    *   Click `Add endpoint`.

5.  **Obtain the Live Webhook Secret for the Vercel Endpoint:**
    *   After adding the endpoint, Stripe will display its details.
    *   Find the **Webhook secret** for this specific endpoint (it starts with `whsec_`). This is your **Live Webhook Secret** for Vercel.
    *   **Copy this secret.** Keep it secure.

6.  **Update `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` on Vercel:**
    *   Go back to your Vercel project's Environment Variables (`Settings` > `Environment Variables`).
    *   Edit the `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` variable.
    *   Paste the **Live Webhook Secret** you just copied from Stripe.
    *   Save the changes.
    *   Vercel will likely trigger a new deployment to apply this change. Confirm the deployment finishes successfully.

Your Vercel deployment is now configured to receive webhook events from Stripe at the specified endpoint, using the correct live keys and webhook secret.
